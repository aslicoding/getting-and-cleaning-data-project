<h1> Getting and cleaning data projece </h1>

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 

The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

This Github repository contains my script for performing data download/ merging/ analysis/ creating tidy data 

It also includes a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations that was  performed 

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
